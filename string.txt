The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable that means we can modify the stringbuffers 
and stringbuilders but can't modify the String.

StringBuffer is synchronized and thread safe. Multiple threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer at a same time. StringBuilder isn't 
synchronized and not thread safe. Multiple threads can call the methods of StringBuilder at a same time, but it exposes the authenticity of
data. StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.


toString() is inbult method. If we apply toString() to any object, will then be returned as a string object. It is the object rpresentation 
in string form. By overriding the toString() method of the Object class, we can return values of the object, so don't need to write
much code.

public String toString(){

//overriding the toString() method  
  

return roll +" "+ name +" "+ marks;  
 
}  

main(){
sout(Student_object);
}
